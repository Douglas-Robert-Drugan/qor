[|] make partitioner find light nodes (using Node::is_light())
[|] turn basic shader into lit
    # almost done here, just need to get light data into shader
[ ] Allow custom materials to invoke shader swaps
    Order of events for this is:
        - Optionally, the mesh looks at current LOD level, stored in Pass
            in: Mesh::render_self
        - Each Mesh modifier sets flags for what attributes they will provide data for
        - The material is queried with these flags for compatibility
        - Depending on the pass and the texture's logic, the material may change the shader (if needed)
            If this happens:
            - It will ensure the texture is bound as well as other uniforms the texture may need (texture matrix?)
            - tells pass to update all the other uniforms for the custom shader
            - Some scoped object returned by Texture should call pass->shader(nullptr) after the render
            - it is likely that this shader will be used again in the next mesh
