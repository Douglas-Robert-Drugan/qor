[|] obj mesh needs to generate tangents
    [>] calc tangents
    [x] avg tangents
* pipeline changes
    [|] merge Pipeline and Pass
    [x] pipeline should be shared across engine states to take advantage of optimizations of remembering GL state
        (recently added)
        [x] mutex if necessary
    [x] remove unnecessary layout resets once you do the above consolidation ^
[x] add Mesh::Data loading (stubbed)
[|] make partitioner find light nodes (using Node::is_light())
[|] turn basic shader into lit
    # almost done here, just need to get light data into shader
[x] have a Material derived from Texture wrap other Textures
[|] change pipeline attributes to be flags to minimize state changes across Mesh cache() calls (enable_layouts(flags))
    Each mesh geometry+modifier's cache() function should return the flag representing the attributes it will use
    Final Attribute flag should be passed to pipeline to minimize state changes and shader incompatibility
[|] Separate textures/skins from other modifiers in mesh data since they can invoke shader changes
    Order of events for this is:
        - Optionally, the mesh looks at current LOD level, stored in Pass
        - Each Mesh modifier sets flags for what attributes they will provide data for
        - The material is queried with these flags for compatibility
        - Depending on the pass and the texture's logic, the material may change the shader (if needed)
            If this happens:
            - It will ensure the texture is bound as well as other uniforms the texture may need (texture matrix?)
            - tells pass to update all the other uniforms for the custom shader
            - Some scoped object returned by Texture should call pass->shader(nullptr) after the render
[x] Cairo support for 2d vector graphics and fonts
[ ] ingame console w/ python commands
* physics
    [|] implement
        # partially done
    [ ] character controller
[ ] particle system
[|] JSON Scene format
[x] cairo surfaces derived from Texture instead of singular with current Canvas
[x] test out pango support

[ ] Input system random speed inconsistent
    # corrupted float or logic being called way more than once?
    [ ] watch player position changes var or MVP matrix changes in debugger
[ ] 2d tilemap drawing is slow (could be related to above)
