[x] BUG: Audio volumes aren't loading from config?
[ ] need separate single-threaded shared_ptr and weak_ptr impl
    [ ] automatic python binding generation may benefit from this? -- only if we use boost
[|] obj mesh needs to generate tangents
    [.] calc tangents -- or use json exporter instead of obj since I think blender generates
    [x] avg tangents
* pipeline changes
    [-] merge Pipeline and Pass
* mathy stuff
    [|] frustum culling
        [|] perspective 
            [x] box detection
            [x] world box pending
            [ ] impl visibility check
    * collision
        [?] Node-box-contains-subnodes guarentee
            # when child added, register listener for move/add
            # node needs vector of scoped_connections (?)
            # flag box for recalculation on child's on_move
[|] make basic lit shader
    # almost done here, just need to get light data into shader
[|] Allow custom materials to invoke shader swaps
    [x] Shader overriding
    [ ] Think of some way materials can hint to shader swaps automatically
    [ ] Rethink texture attribute detection -- is this efficient?:
    Order of events for this is:
        - Optionally, the mesh looks at current LOD level, stored in Pass
            in: Mesh::render_self
        - Each Mesh modifier sets flags for what attributes they will provide data for
        - The material is queried with these flags for compatibility
        - Depending on the pass and the texture's logic, the material may change the shader (if needed)
            If this happens:
            - It will ensure the texture is bound as well as other uniforms the texture may need (texture matrix?)
            - tells pass to update all the other uniforms for the custom shader
            - Some scoped object returned by Texture should call pass->shader(nullptr) after the render
            - it is likely that this shader will be used again in the next mesh
[L] ingame console w/ python commands
    [x] need text input
    [|] start console
        [x] planning
        [|] impl
        [ ] console can be reliant on session and store its history there
        [ ] finish
    # already have python scripting integration, just need the gui for this
* physics
    [x] implement bullet
    [x] raycasting
    [ ] enable collision testing for non-physical bodies
    [ ] physics-based character controller
* input
    [ ] Add some helper methods for grabbing+pushing controller bind mappings like in bouncingship's MenuState
        [ ] Input needs to support rebinding and overriding
        [ ] finish bind(...) which should sync settings between profile and input of that controller
        [ ] rewrite reload() using meta instead of jsoncpp calls
    [ ] double-binding (a->command, b->command) works only last bound command
    [ ] Profile config writing doesn't write arrays (?) -- probably in issue in kit not covered by tests
* audio
    [|] Music continuing instead of resetting
        [x] Add skip cache detection for audio streams
        [?] still happening?
[ ] particle system
    [ ] take code from old one, but make it shader-based
[ ] JSON Scene format
    [ ] finish Blender exporter
    [ ] loader
[L] BUG: when state needs_load() is false, enter() is not executed
[L] convert tile uv generation to texture atlas

* blender exporter
    [ ] not being detected in newer blender versions
    [ ] BUG: indices are all zero
    [ ] non-material-bound images set to faces via UV editor aren't detected
    
[x] improved method for batching existing objects together in a shared VBO
[ ] Shadow buffers
    [ ] need to test renderbuffer support
    [ ] shadow shader
[ ] SSAO
[ ] Parititioner needs optimization
