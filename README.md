2D/3D OpenGL Game Engine (C++11 w/ Python scripting)

Copyright (c) 2011-2016 Grady O'Connell

See CREDITS for a list of contributers.
    
Status: Hobby project, still tinkering

This is a rewrite of my [older game engine](https://github.com/flipcoder/qor-old).

##Instructions

- Initialize the kit submodule and checkout the master branch:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
git submodule foreach --recursive git checkout master
```

- Get the libraries:

```
Vorbis, Boost, Jsoncpp, Pthread, Bullet, Sdl2, Raknet, Glew, Assimp, Freeimage, Glm, Freealut, Rapidxml, Openal, Cairomm, Ogg, Pangomm, Catch, Backward-cpp
```

- Build Qor with [premake4](http://industriousone.com/premake/download):

```
premake4 gmake
make -j`nproc`
```

- [siege-tools](https://github.com/flipcoder/siege-tools) is recommended.
- Read the documentation: [QorBook](https://github.com/flipcoder/qor/blob/master/QorBook.md)

##Features

    - Node factory supporting user classes
    - Node tags
    - Many 3D model formats supported
    - Blender scene exporter

    - User-defined engine states
    - Async loading screens
- Input
    - Multiple controllers
    - Bindings specific to player profiles
    - Button/switch-associated events
    - Switch history for timer-based events and multiple fast press events
    - Activation thresholds
- Animation (code moved to [kit](https://github.com/flipcoder/kit))
    - Timer-based keyframes
    - Interpolation/Easing
    - Callback scheduling
- Music and 3D Sound
    - Powered by OpenAL
    - Wav and Ogg support
    - Thread-safe
- [Cairo](http://cairographics.org) 2D primitives w/ Render-To-Texture
- [Pango](http://pango.org) Font and Text Rendering
- Headless mode for dedicated servers and unit testing

More features will be listed as I add them...

##Partial/WIP Features 
- Level-of-detail
- Particle systems (rewriting this atm)
- Shader selection based on mesh and material properties (almost done)
- Better instancing
- Python bindings are currently very limited
- More documentation and user-friendliness
