2D/3D OpenGL Game Engine (C++11 w/ Python scripting)
    
Status: Hobby project, still tinkering

This is a rewrite of my [older game engine](https://github.com/flipcoder/qor-old).

##Instructions

- My C++11 common toolset, [kit](http://github.com/flipcoder/kit), is required.
- *premake4.lua* contains a list of libraries you will need.
- Build Qor with [premake4](http://industriousone.com/premake/download).
- [siege-tools](https://github.com/flipcoder/siege-tools) is recommended.
- Example mods and scripts will be available soon in a separate repository.
- Read the documentation: [QorBook](https://github.com/flipcoder/qor/blob/master/QorBook.md)

##Features

- Cross-platform
- Multi-threaded (more improvements here soon)
- Multi-layer tilemap system for 2D games
    - Compatible with [Tiled](http://mapeditor.org) map editor
- OpenGL ES-compatible shader-based pipeline
    - Forward rendering w/ multipass lighting
    - Several shaders, including tangent-space bumpmapping
    - Partitioner/culling support
    - Automatic VBO baking of visible areas (10x framerate in many cases)
    - Mesh instance copy-on-write vertex and shader attribute modifications
    - Basic instancing
    - Render-to-Texture
    - Thread-safe OpenGL task handler
- C++ and Python support
- Python Console
- Shared resource management
    - Animating Sprites
    - Resource management and multiple path search
    - Resource caching
    - Basic create() function for all types
    - Json config for more complex resources
        - Config-based type-resolution and subresources
    - Composite/nested resource suport
    - User-defined resources
- 3D Scene graph
    - World matrix transform caching
    - Static mesh baking (collapse to world space and combine)
    - Tracking/following w/ animation support
    - Node factory supporting user classes
    - Node tags
    - Many 3D model formats supported
    - Blender scene exporter
- Reactive Subsystems
    - Communicate with/between nodes easily by sending/receiving data through named metaobject/json events
    - Each node has a lightweight state machine with signal support
    - User-defined events and states
- State stack
    - User-defined engine states
    - Async loading screens
- Input
    - Multiple controllers
    - Bindings specific to player profiles
    - Button/switch-associated events
    - Switch history for timer-based events and multiple fast press events
    - Activation thresholds
- Animation (code moved to [kit](https://github.com/flipcoder/kit))
    - Timer-based keyframes
    - Interpolation/Easing
    - Callback scheduling
- Music and 3D Sound
    - Powered by OpenAL
    - Wav and Ogg support
    - Thread-safe
- [Cairo](http://cairographics.org) 2D primitives w/ Render-To-Texture
- [Pango](http://pango.org) Font and Text Rendering
- Headless mode for dedicated servers and unit testing

More features will be listed as I add them...

##Partial/WIP Features 
- Level-of-detail
- Particle systems (rewriting this atm)
- Shader selection based on mesh and material properties (almost done)
- Better instancing
- Python bindings are currently very limited
- More documentation and user-friendliness

##Credits

All engine source, (and that of prior versions), is my own work.
The siege-tools build system and header-only kit library is also my own original work.
The other libraries used, such as boost, glm, SDL, etc. are all property of their respective owners.
Check the licenses of these libraries for details.

Graphics resources used in demos, screenshots, and videos, were contributed by:
[Mark "Alfred" McDaniel](http://github.com/alfredanonymous)

There are a few minor exceptions, such as the Qor logo, which I did myself.
